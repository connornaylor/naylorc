  <h2>You shouldn’t have to be a developer to launch a great product</h2>
  <p>Most non-technical teams struggle to brief, scope, or manage developers — especially when working with third-party agencies.</p>
  <p>Projects go over budget, communication breaks down, and the final product often misses the mark.</p>
  <p>I've seen it happen time and time again — and I’m here to fix that.</p>

  <h2>I act as your technical delivery partner</h2>
  <p>I bridge the gap between your team and your developers — so nothing gets lost in translation.</p>

    <li><strong>Agency Vetting</strong> – I help you select the right dev partner for your budget, goals, and tech stack.</li>
    <li><strong>Delivery Oversight</strong> – I manage the project from kickoff to launch, handling coordination, QA, and course-correction.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Advisory</strong> – Need help choosing tools, platforms, or workflows? I’ve got you.</li>
  </ul>
