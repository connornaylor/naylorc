## You shouldn’t have to be a developer to launch a great product

Most non-technical teams struggle to brief, scope, or manage developers — especially when working with third-party agencies.

Projects go over budget, communication breaks down, and the final product often misses the mark.

I've seen it happen time and time again — and I’m here to fix that.

## I act as your technical delivery partner

I bridge the gap between your team and your developers — so nothing gets lost in translation.

### Services I offer:
- **Project Scoping** – I take your idea and turn it into a clear, developer-ready brief.
- **Agency Vetting** – I help you select the right dev partner for your budget, goals, and tech stack.
- **Delivery Oversight** – I manage the project from kickoff to launch, handling day-to-day coordination, QA, and course-correction.
- **Technical Advisory** – Need help choosing tools, platforms, or workflows? I’ve got you.
